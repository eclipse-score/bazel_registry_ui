# Eclipse S-CORE Bazel Registry Modules Web UI

This repository provides a web UI for the [Eclipse S‑CORE Bazel Modules Registry](https://github.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry).
It entirely consists of statically rendered pages, which are updated as soon as a new commit is pushed to the registry.

## Maintenance and Support

This repo is funded by contributions to our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/bazel-rules-authors-sig/projects/bazel-central-registry).
Maintenance is performed on a best-effort basis by volunteers in the Bazel community.

## Contributing

We are happy about any contributions!

To get started you can take a look at our [Github issues](https://github.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry_ui/issues).

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be licensed as below, without any additional terms or
conditions.

### Getting Started

Note that the git repo is enormous, due to the regularly published files in the `gh-pages` branch. To avoid downloading tens of gigabytes of data, use a shallow clone:

```bash
git clone --depth 5 https://github.com/eclipse-score/bazel_registry_ui
```

We use git submodules to include the data from eclipse-score/bazel_registry, so after cloning this repo you need to run:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

To get a buildifier and buildozer on your PATH, you also need to run this before launching the app:

```bash
bazel run //bin:bazel_env
```

Packages are managed via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), so they can be installed via `npx pnpm install`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000/bazel_registry_ui> with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Learn More about Next.js

The page is built on top of Next.js.
